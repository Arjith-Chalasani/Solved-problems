The point equidistant to all the points is the Centroid.
To find the centroid, average the X and Y coordinates.

Q : If the best location is not exactly on a grid point, choose the grid point closest to the best location.
Break ties by choosing the point that has the smallest x coordinate and then the smallest y coordinate.

A : Case 1 : If centroid co ordinates are x : 32.4 , y : 27.8 => Output is x : 32 , y : 28
    Case 2 : If centroid co ordinates are x : 32.5, y : 22.5 i.e x is equidistant to both 32 and 33.
    Smallest of 32 and 33 has to be choosen. So the output should be => Output is x : 32, y : 22
